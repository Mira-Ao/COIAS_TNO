# COIAS_TNO
TNO Candidate
This is my full 2-night TNO trclets list until now.

Since I transcribe directly from my note-taking, the annotations I wrote for myself are also retained.
2d means for two nights, and arc2d means that there is only one or two days between the two nights.

update
2024/9/23 - add new candidate
